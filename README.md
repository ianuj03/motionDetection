# motionDetection
Interfacing PIR/Motion sensor with Arduino UNO. 

If the motion is detected then blow alarm. 
PIR acronym for Passive Infrared, checks for the infrared light and hence widely used  as a motion sensor.

### Connection:
```
Vcc- 5V Power supply.
Data- The centre PIN is the data PIN; connect it to any of the digital PIN.
GND- Ground PIN.
```
__NOTE:__ Identify a red colored component on the module just near the PINs of the module; this is called as Protection Diode, next to which is the +Vcc, then Data, and then GND.
